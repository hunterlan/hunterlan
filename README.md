# Hi, I'm Konstantin. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student, who studies on software engingeering. **I really love programming!** My favorite stack is .NET. A lot of my projects was made by me, using .NET and .NET Core.

Also, I familiar with Java, SQL, C/C++, Python, HTML, CSS and JS. They are also good, but they cannot replace .NET Core. 

I worked with Docker, MySQL, MS SQL, Unity, GTK. 

Except programming, I do sport, especially football (soccer) and athletic. I like to run with people. Better it can be team play and emotional, like in football!

Also, I'm a volunteer and change the world around me!
